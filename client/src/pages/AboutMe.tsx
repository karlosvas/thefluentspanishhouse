            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>
              Hello, I am Marta Gutiérrez Fonseca, a Spanish teacher with years
              of experience helping students from all over the world master this
              beautiful language.
              <br />
              My passion is teaching, and my goal is for my students not only to
              learn to speak Spanish fluently but also to fall in love with the
              culture surrounding it.

            <h2>What do I offer?</h2>
            <p>
              My classes are designed to be dynamic, challenging, and
              stimulating, adapting to the individual needs of each student. I
              firmly believe that mastering fundamental grammatical structures
              is crucial for achieving effective and confident communication.
              <br />
              With a personalized approach and custom-made materials, my lessons
              focus not only on theory but also on constant practice, with an
              emphasis on oral reproduction of the language.
              <br /> I speak with a neutral accent and clearly, and I always
              encourage my students to ask questions and clarify their doubts.
              <br />

            <h2>How will our classes be?</h2>

              I offer private lessons for all levels, from A1 to C1, using video
              conferencing platforms such as Zoom, Skype, and Google Meet.
              <br /> Additionally, I provide all the necessary learning
              materials, as well as assignments and constant communication
              outside of class to resolve any doubts.
              <br />
